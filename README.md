New Group Theory Notes!

The "notes" files contains the notes verbatim from the course per day. The "Notes - Structured" files contain an outline of the course, and will be filled in with the content once it is edited. 

Feel free to use as you wish. Any suggested changes are appreciated, but don't feel like you need to spend time catching things. I'm going to spend this week editing them, and I would feel bad if we duplicated too much of the work and wasted time.

The first draft has been updated with a first pass of edits; typos were fixed, imporoved consistency in notation and style, and explanded and clarified a few explanations. The PDF's have not been updated. I will work on assimilating the content into the structured format tomorrow.
